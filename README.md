# SecureVote
## Codefundo 19
To make voting more secure,reliable and transparent to voters, following features are useful :
* Universal Vote Meter is available to public to see live number of votes registered with addition of their votes.
* Using Blockchain technology it will become more secure by matching vote count with voters.
* Online Voting facility for voters out of their voting region by giving their Adhaar Details with matching of an OTP and face matching.
* No issue for the voters with no voting card, an automatic ID card generator by entering Adhaar Details at polling booth (specially designed for voters became eligible this time).
## How does it going to work?
Implementing Azure Blockchain technology in voting centrally controlled for example each booth is connected to other booths through blockchain which will give us total counts of vote by matching the number of voter and real time result.
Also In case of no ID card virtual card can be made through dataset of voters at the spot of voting.
<br><br> Dataset will be taken as per codefundo website or sample dataset will be made which will have information of voters.
